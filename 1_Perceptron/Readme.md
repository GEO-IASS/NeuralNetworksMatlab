# Learning rule for single perceptrons
Run file simulate.m on Matlab or Octave. You can modify it for a dataset of your choice. This simulation demonstrates how the simplistic learning rule of a perceptron, can update weights efficiently when the classes are linear separable. However, if the classes are not linear separable the algorithm doesn't converge.
